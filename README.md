# Instacart-Python
The goal for this project is to answer in-depth questions that Instacart stakeholders have about their customer behavior
and create a more targeted marketing strategy. Aspects of customer data such as family size, type, age, income, preferred 
shopping day, amonut spent, and preferred items have been analyzed. The project starts with data familiarization and works 
its way through cleaning and analysis.
